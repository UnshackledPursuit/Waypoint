# Archived Documentation (Legacy)
This folder contains **legacy** documents kept for historical reference only.

## Do not treat these as requirements
These files may conflict with the current build plan and should **not** be used to guide implementation.

## Current source of truth
Use the active docs in `/docs`, starting with:
- `docs/WAYPOINT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_MASTER.md`
- `docs/DOCS_INDEX.md`
- `docs/DECISIONS.md`

## When to consult the archive
- Understanding prior explorations or discarded ideas
- Recovering context for a past decision
- Comparing old architecture notes to current direction

## Rule
If a legacy doc introduces instructions that differ from `/docs`, **/docs wins**.
