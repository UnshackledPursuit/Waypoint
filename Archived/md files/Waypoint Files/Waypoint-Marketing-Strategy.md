## X (Twitter) Strategy

### Your Network Leverage

#### Phase 1: Pre-Launch Teasing (Week 1-2 before launch)

**Post 1: Visual Teaser**
```
Been working on something spatial... 🌌

[10-second clip: Orbs scattering]

Thoughts?
```
- No explanation
- Just eye candy
- Tag #visionOS #SpatialComputing
- Posts in evening EST (peak engagement)

**Post 2: Problem Statement**
```
Vision Pro bookmark management is... not great.

Multiple apps, buried folders, no spatial organization.

What if your links lived in 3D space? 

Working on something. 👀
```
- Validates problem
- Hints at solution
- Engagement bait ("What are you building?")

**Post 3: Feature Tease**
```
Constellation launching. 🚀

5 portals → 2 seconds → entire workflow open.

Coming soon to Vision Pro.

[GIF: Constellation tap → portals scatter → all open]
```
- Shows killer feature
- Creates curiosity
- No CTAs yet (building anticipation)

#### Phase 2: Launch Day

**Main Launch Post:**
```
Today: Waypoint is live on Vision Pro. 🌌

Universal link manager built for spatial computing.
• Drag & drop anything → instant portal

## App Icon & Logo Design

### The Challenge

You struggle with design. Totally normal. Here's the solution:

### Option A: AI-Generated (Cheap, Fast)

**Midjourney Prompt:**
```
App icon for visionOS spatial computing app, glowing portal orb, cosmic theme, glass sphere with inner light, deep space background, minimalist, modern, professional, blue and purple gradient, 1024x1024, vector style, no text
```

**Refinement:**
- Generate 20 variations
- Pick best 3
- Refine details
- Export at 1024x1024

**Tools:**
- Midjourney ($10/month)
- DALL-E 3 (via ChatGPT Plus)
- Stable Diffusion (free but harder)

**Cost:** $10-30  
**Time:** 2-4 hours

### Option B: Fiverr Designer (Mid-Range)

**Search:** "visionOS app icon designer"

**Budget:** $50-150

**Deliverables:**
- 5 concepts
- 2 rounds of revisions
- Final icon at all sizes
- Source files

**Timeline:** 3-7 days

**Pro Tip:** Show them:
- Your 30-second demo video
- Competitor icons (but yours should be unique)
- Reference images (portal, orb, cosmic themes)

### Option C: Professional Designer (Premium)

**Platform:** Dribbble, hire designer with visionOS work

**Budget:** $300-800

**Deliverables:**
- Full brand package (icon, logo, wordmark)
- App icon variants (light/dark)
- Social media assets
- Brand guidelines

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks

**Worth it if:** You want premium positioning + have budget

---

### My Icon Concept Recommendations

**Concept 1: Portal Orb (Recommended)**
```
Design:
- Glowing sphere (glass material)
- Inner light/energy
- Subtle depth (3D feel)
- Blue → Purple gradient
- Clean, minimal

Vibe: Magical, spatial, premium
```

**Concept 2: Constellation Map**
```
Design:
- 5 small orbs in circle
- Connected by light lines
- Constellation pattern
- Deep space background
- Teal/cyan color

Vibe: Organizational, systematic
```

**Concept 3: Portal Doorway**
```
Design:
- Circular portal/ring
- Glowing edges
- Depth/dimension
- Starfield visible through
- Blue/white light

Vibe: Gateway, journey, exploration
```

**My Pick: Concept 1 (Portal Orb)**

**Why:**
- Simple (recognizable at small size)
- Unique (doesn't look like other productivity apps)
- Premium (glass material = quality)
- Scalable (works at all sizes)
- On-brand (matches orb visualization in app)

### DIY Quick Solution (If Budget = $0)

**Use SF Symbols + Gradient:**
1. Open SF Symbols app (free from Apple)
2. Search: "circle.hexagongrid.circle" or "sphere"
3. Export at 1024x1024
4. Open in Figma (free)
5. Add radial gradient (blue → purple)
6. Add outer glow
7. Export as PNG

**Result:** Not amazing, but functional for launch

**Upgrade later** when you have revenue.

## Logo & Wordmark

**Logo = Icon + "Waypoint" text**

**Font Recommendations:**
- SF Pro Display (Bold) - Native Apple, clean
- Inter (Semibold) - Modern, tech feel
- Outfit (Bold) - Geometric, spatial vibe

**Style:**
```
[Icon] WAYPOINT
  ↑       ↑
 orb    bold, uppercase
```

**Color:**
- Text: White (on dark) or Deep Blue (on light)
- Icon: Full color (gradient)

**Where Used:**
- App Store listing header
- Website hero section
- Social media headers
- Press kit

**Create in:** Figma (free) or Canva (free tier works)

## Website Strategy

### Do You Need a Website? Yes, But Simple.

**Purpose:**
1. App Store link hub
2. Demo video hosting
3. Press kit / media assets
4. Email capture (future)

**Don't Need:**
- Stripe integration (App Store handles payments)
- User accounts / auth
- Database (Supabase not needed)
- E-commerce (Shopify overkill)

---

### Recommended Stack: NextJS + Vercel

✅ **Vercel:**
- Free hosting
- Auto-deploys from GitHub
- Fast global CDN

- Utility-first (easy to style)
- Looks modern by default
- Small bundle size

✅ **shadcn/ui:**
- Pre-built components (buttons, cards, etc.)
- Copy-paste, no install
- Looks professional

**What You DON'T Need:**
- ❌ Stripe (App Store handles billing)
- ❌ Supabase (no user data to store)
- ❌ Shopify (way overkill, expensive)
- ❌ Auth (no login needed)

---

**Don't Overdo It:**
- Max 1 email per month (outside of campaigns)
- Always value-first (not salesy)
- Easy unsubscribe

---

Subject: Waypoint - Spatial Link Manager for Vision Pro

Hi [Name],

I'm [Your Name], and I built Waypoint - a spatial link manager for Vision Pro.

Instead of buried bookmarks, users create "portals" that appear as 3D orbs. Group them into "constellations" and launch entire workflows with one tap.

The interesting part: I built a materia-style drag & drop system (inspired by FF7) where users slot portals into constellations. Plus a full immersive management space inspired by FFX's Sphere Grid.

100+ users in first month, 4.8★ rating. Would you be interested in covering it?

Press kit: waypointapp.com/press
Demo video: [YouTube link]

Thanks for considering,
[Your Name]
```

## What NOT to Do

### Marketing Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Posting too much** (seems desperate)
- Max 1 post per day on launch week
- Then 3-4 per week ongoing

❌ **Buying ads early** (waste of money)
- Organic first (X network)
- Paid ads later (if organic stalls)

❌ **Overexplaining features** (boring)
- Show, don't tell
- Videos > Text

❌ **Comparing to competitors** (looks insecure)
- Focus on your unique value
- Don't mention other apps

❌ **Ignoring negative reviews** (looks bad)
- Respond to ALL reviews (especially negative)
- Fix bugs fast

❌ **Spamming Reddit** (gets banned)
- One post in r/VisionPro
- Engage genuinely in comments
- Don't repost

---

## Final Thoughts

### What Matters Most (Priority Order)

1. **Product quality** - Orb UX must be magical
2. **Demo video** - 30 seconds that WOWs
3. **X network** - Your existing relationships
4. **App Store presence** - Clean listing, good screenshots
5. **Pricing clarity** - Simple, transparent
6. **Everything else** - Website, press, email (nice-to-haves)

### Your Actual Marketing Superpower

**It's not your X network size.**

**It's that you built something genuinely unique in a nascent platform (visionOS) where everyone is hungry for quality apps.**

- visionOS = 200K users, 90% are early adopters
- Early adopters = Love trying new apps
- Quality productivity apps = Rare on visionOS
- Your orb UX = Genuinely differentiated

**You don't need to be a marketing genius. You need to:**

1. Make a great app
2. Show people the great app
3. Let the app sell itself

**The materia-style orb system you described? That's a 10/10 idea. If you execute that well, marketing becomes easy.**

---

## Next Steps (Immediately)

1. **Save this document** ✅
2. **Pick icon concept** (Portal Orb recommended)
3. **Create icon** (Midjourney $10 or Fiverr $50-100)
4. **Buy domain** (waypointapp.com or similar, $12)
5. **Build website** (NextJS template or v0.dev, free)
6. **Continue building app** (Phases 2-8)

Marketing prep while you build. Launch when ready.

---

**End of Marketing Strategy Document**

*This is your reference. Bookmark it. When you're 2 weeks from launch, read it again and execute.*

**The app will sell itself if the orb UX is as good as we've designed. Focus on making that magical first.** ✨
